### Django Installation & Setting up a new project
- Go to the desired directory where you want to setup your project.
- Open `Command Prompt` there or any command line environment.
- First create Virtual Environment and activate it in the same directory.
  - `python -m venv .env` : It will create `.env` folder.
  - `.env\scripts\activate` : It will activate virtual environment.
  - `Note` : Python virtual environments give you the ability to isolate your Python development projects from your system installed Python and other Python environments. This gives you full control of your project and makes it easily reproducible.
- Install Django : `pip install django` - This will install Django framework.
- Run the command `django-admin` for checking proper installment of django. It will run smoothly in case of proper installation.
- Run the command `django-admin startproject projectname` : This will create projects (some directories) inside the folder as shown below. `projectname` can be anything. Example shown below using `myapp`
